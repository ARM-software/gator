"""
The `gator_me.py` script helps set up either an interactive Streamline capture,
or a headless gatord capture, for a single debuggable package running on a
non-rooted Android device. This script requires Python 3.5 or higher.


Prerequisites
=============

The test application APK must be debuggable and pre-installed on to the
target device prior to starting this script.

By default the script will look for the `gatord` binary to use in the current
working directory on the host. The following instructions will assume that
this is the case, but a user can specify a different path using the `--daemon`
command line option.

Headless captures need a capture configuration; by default the script will look
for a `configuration.xml` configuration file in the current working directory
on the host. The following instructions will assume that this is the case, but
a user can specify a different path using the `--config` command line option.
Note that interactive captures can optionally also specify the `--config`
option to use a pre-determined set of counters, but this is optional as
interactive use will prompt for a configuration via the Streamline GUI.


Interactive capture
===================

Interactive captures set up gatord on the device, but use the Streamline GUI
for configuring and capturing data. For a simple interactive captures run the
following command line:

    python gator_me.py --package <name>

The on-screen prompts will inform you when it is safe to switch to the
Streamline GUI and capture your test data.

Once you have finished the data capture in Streamline return to the console
running the script and press the <Enter> key to clean up the device and
complete the test run.

If you do not know your package name you can run without the `--package`
option. In this case the script will search your device for debuggable packages
and prompt you to select one. The search can be quite slow, so it is
recommended to use the `--package` option once you know the package name.


Headless capture
================

Headless captures setup gatord on the device, and use gatord standalone to
capture data without the Streamline GUI connected. For a simple headless
capture run the following command line:

    python gator_me.py --package <name> --headless <output>

This will use the `configuration.xml` in the current working directory to
perform a headless capture and store the results back to the output location on
the host. Outputs may be either a directory of the format <name.apc> or a file
of the format <name.apc.zip>. The path leading up to the output location must
exist already; the script will exit with an error if it doesn't.

By default headless captures stop when the test application exits on the
target. Note that the application must exit, not suspend. Alternatively
a fixed timeout can be specified using the `--headless-timeout` option,
which will capture that many seconds of data before exiting.

Headless captures will throw an error if the output location already exists.
To avoid this you can run with the `--overwrite` option, which will forcefully
delete the existing location and replace it with new data.

The output file can be imported into the Streamline GUI via two methods:

* If you wrote an ".apc" directory you can drag the directory from the host
  OS file explorer into the Streamline Data View capture list.
* If you wrote an ".apc.zip" file you can either drag the file from the host
  OS file explorer into the Streamline Data View capture list, or you can
  import the file using the import button in the Data View.


Power-user arguments
====================

By default the script will clean up the device before the test to stop old
files and processes being used by mistake. This can be disabled by setting
`--no-clean-start`, but this is not recommended.

By default the script will clean up the device after the test to leave the
device in a clean state for the next test. This can be disabled by setting
`--no-clean-end`, but this is not recommended. In particular note that
uninstalling the test application before killing the `gatord` process will
render `gatord` unkillable. No further profiling will be possible until the
target device is power cycled.


Hosts with multiple devices connected
=====================================

For host machines with a single debuggable device connected, this script will
auto-detect and use that device. If you have a machine with multiple devices
connected, for example a continuous integration server, you must either select
the device interactively from the menu or specify the device name on the
command line. For convenience, the command line may be a partial prefix of the
full name, provided that the prefix uniquely identifies a single device.
