*** Annotations
Annotations are a way for users to gain insight into their user space application via instrumenting source code.
To use these annotations, include streamline_annotate.h and streamline_annotate.c into your project, or include a libstreamline_annotate library built using the Makefile.
The different annotation types include:
	String: works in a similar way to printf but instead of console output, string messages populate the Log view and place framing overlays directly in the Timeline view
	Visual: adds an image to the Visual Annotation Chart and also populates the Log view
	Marker: places a bookmark into the Timeline view highlighting an interesting event in time
	Counter: dynamically creates a counter chart (numeric values plotted over time) to the Timeline view
	Custom Activity Map (CAM): allows the user to define and visualize a complicated dependency chain of jobs and events

*** Examples
* Simple examples for all the above annotation types are available in the streamline/examples folder.
* For more complicated examples, import the Linux application example projects into DS-5 Eclipse and refer to readme.html for more details.

*** Java annotations
StreamlineAnnotate.java provides methods for String, Visual, and Marker annotations.

*** Kernel/module annotations
String, Visual, and Marker annotations are supported from within the kernel or a module by including streamline_annotate.h (streamline_annotate.c need not be included in the project).
The same macros are defined for both user space and kernel space using the _KERNEL_ preprocessor conditional.
See the mmapped example in the gator driver source code and in the documentation for details on adding Counter annotations to kernel space.
