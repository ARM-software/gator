/**
 *  Hardware counters reader interface.
 *
 * Hardware counters are collected in the kernel space and delivered to the
 * user space using a ring buffer. The ring buffer has constant unspecified
 * size.
 *
 * To get counter values, the user should call @ref reader::get_sample. The
 * function waits until the sample is taken, and then acquires its entry
 * in the ring buffer, so the kernel does not modify this memory. Only one
 * sample can be processed at a time.
 *
 * The counter values can be obtained from the hardware counter blocks, which
 * can be iterated over using @ref reader::next.
 *
 * When the user is done with the counters processing, they should hand
 * the ring buffer entry back to the kernel using @ref reader::put_sample.
 *
 * If the user does not empty the ring buffer fast enough it may overflow.
 * In this case the values are kept accumulating what may result into counter
 * values overflow. If overflow behavior is defined,
 * @ref features::overflow_behavior_defined is set.
 *
 * @par Example
 * @code
 * namespace hwcnt = hwcpipe::device::hwcnt;
 * hwcnt::sample_metadata sample_metadata;
 * hwcnt::block_metadata block_metadata;
 * hwcnt::sample_handle sh{};
 * hwcnt::block_handle bh{};
 *
 * // Obtain reader from a sampler
 * hwcnt::reader &r = sampler.get_reader();
 * // Wait for sample and read it.
 * r.get_sample(sample_metadata, sh);
 * // Iterate over hardware counters blocks and process them.
 * for (;r.next(sh, block_metadata, bh);)
 *     process_block(block_metadata);
 * // Return sample back to the ring buffer.
 * r.put_sample(sh);
 * @endcode
