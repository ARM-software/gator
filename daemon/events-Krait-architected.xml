    <event event="0x1" title="L1 Instruction Cache" name="Refill" description="The counter counts instruction memory accesses that cause a refill of at least the Level 1 instruction or unified cache. This includes each instruction memory access that causes a refill from outside the cache. It excludes accesses that do not cause a new cache refill but are satisfied from refilling data of a previous miss."/>

This includes each instruction memory access that causes an access to a level of memory system due to a translation table walk or an access to another level of TLB caching."/>
    <event event="0x3" title="L1 Data Cache" name="Refill" description="The counter counts each memory-read operation or memory-write operation that causes a refill of at least the Level 1 data or unified cache from outside the Level 1 cache. Each access that causes a new linefill is counted, including those from instructions that generate multiple accesses, such as load or store multiples, and PUSH and POP instructions. In particular, the counter counts accesses to the Level 1 cache that cause a refill that is satisfied by another Level 1 data or unified cache, or a Level 2 cache, or memory."/>
    <event event="0x4" title="L1 Data Cache" name="Access" description="The counter counts each memory-read operation or memory-write operation that causes a cache access to at least the Level 1 data or unified cache. Each access to a cache line is counted including the multiple accesses of instructions, such as LDM or STM . Each access to other Level 1 data or unified memory structures, for example refill buffers, write buffers, and write- back buffers, is also counted."/>
    <event event="0x5" title="L1 Data TLB" name="Refill" description="The counter counts each memory-read operation or memory-write operation that causes a TLB refill of at least the Level 1 data or unified TLB. It counts each read or write that causes a refill, in the form of a translation table walk or an access to another level of TLB caching."/>
